## Introduction
Internet usage has grown exponentially, affecting every aspect of modern life. This project provides a structured approach to analyzing internet usage data by preparing and inspecting it for insights into user behavior.

---

## Features
- **Data Importation**: Load and inspect datasets related to internet usage.
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare and format data for further analysis.
- **Preliminary Analysis**: Conduct basic exploration to understand data structure and trends.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Handling**: Pandas
  - **Basic Analysis**: NumPy

---

## Data Analysis Process
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Import raw datasets into Python for examination.
2. **Data Inspection**:
   - Review dataset structure, including column types and missing values.
3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Clean and format data for usability, ensuring consistency across entries.
4. **Exploration Setup**:
   - Summarize key statistics and trends to identify areas for deeper analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blessingitodo/Analyzing-Internet-Use.git
   cd internet-usage-analysis
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Future Work
- Add visualizations to illustrate trends in internet usage (e.g., by age group, time of day, or region).
- Perform advanced analysis, such as clustering user behaviors or forecasting usage patterns.
- Integrate additional datasets for a more comprehensive understanding of internet behavior.
